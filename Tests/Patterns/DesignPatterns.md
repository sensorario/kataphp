# Design Pattern

A friend of mine once tell me that we are not developers: we are just "copy and pasters". I think we cant copy and paste code with tdd. But the truth is that a lot of problems and issues are yet already resolved by someone. If formalized these solutions can be called "Design Pattern". A design pattern is a way to solve specific problem. If we isolate each stuff of a problem, we can find the right pattern to implement. And TDD can be a good way to find patterns.

## About interfaces

Interface are particular classes that implements a behavior. Animal is not a good name of an interface. Versable is a better name becouse tell developer that classes who implements this interface has a behavior of something that has a verse.
