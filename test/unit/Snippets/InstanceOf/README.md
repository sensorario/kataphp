# Instance of

This is a very nicety. First, to check if two classes are one subclass and another the superclass, I instantiate both objects using instanceOf. Through tests I had found on github sources, I had learned this snippet of code. Is not necessary to instantiate a class, to check if this class is subclass of another.
